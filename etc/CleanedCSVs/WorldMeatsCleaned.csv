0,Lacón Gallego,Spain,Galicia,"Lacón Gallego is a cured and dried ham produced in the region of Galicia. This type of ham, unlike the jamon, is produced solely from pigs' shoulders. The breeds used in the production of this ham are Celt, Large White, Landrace or Duroc. There are two types of Lacón Gallego, depending on how the pigs are fed. Traditional Lacón Gallego is made from pigs that have been fed with acorns, grains, and vegetables for at least three months before the slaughter.

1,Westfälischer Knochenschinken,Germany,Westphalia,"The pork used to make this ham originates from the region of Westphalia, which is known for its traditional pig farming. The recipe is guarded as a trade secret, and every step in the production process is carried out entirely by hand. The process begins by rubbing salt of a special consistency with added herbs or spices into the ham and bone, which is then left to cure and dry in aging rooms for an extended period of time. To produce the smoked version, the hams are left in a smoking chamber over a beech and juniper wood fire. This process may take time, but it results in a characteristic dark red meat, golden-yellow rind, and a particularly mild and nutty flavor. To enjoy this delicacy, slice it thinly and serve it as an appetizer with pretzels and cheese."

The origins can be traced back to the 1400s - some sources claim that it was originally prepared with horse meat rather than beef. Nowadays, many varieties exist, the most common being those made with beef, deer, or pork. Slinzega can be used as a flavor enhancer in cooking, or eaten on its own, thinly sliced or cut into little cubes and served with bread."

Produced in the Arda Valley southeast from the city of Piacenza, Coppa Piacentina is made with a big, round cut of pork that runs from where the shoulder meets the neck to the fourth-sixth rib of what is known as pork carré. The meat is stuffed into natural pork or beef casings, and aged between six months to a year."
51,Tiroler Speck,Austria,Tyrol,"Produced in a traditional manner by Austrian farmers, Tiroler Speck is one of the oldest Tyrolean specialties whose origins can be traced back to the 1500s. This bacon is first dry-salted and seasoned with a special blend of spices, cold smoked over beech wood, and finally dried and matured in the crisp Alpine air. Prepared in this manner, Tyrolean bacon developes its uniquely intense flavor. Traditionally served in thin slices, Tiroler Speck is an essential part of what is known as Bretteljause or Marend, a typical Austrian platter with assorted meats."
52,Dehesa de Extremadura,Spain,Province Of Cáceres,"Dehesa de Extremadura is a cured ham and shoulders made of pure-bred Ibérico-pigs meat produced in the provinces of Cáceres and Badajoz. The manufacturing process takes at least 18 months for hams and 12 months for the shoulders and consists of salting, resting, curing and aging.

It can optionally be lightly smoked with chestnut wood."
55,Prosciutto di Norcia,Italy,Province Of Perugia,"Here in the mountainous Umbria, a region rich in oak forests where the tradition of pig breeding and meat curing dates back to the Roman times, it is said that a good prosciutto needs to 'live through at least one winter and one summer'. This variety of prosciutto is produced in the province of Perugia, namely the town of Norcia and in the Valnerina valley. There are two types of Prosciutto di Norcia. The widely popular Tipico di Norcia, also known as Salato or Prosciutto di Montagna, is aged for up to 12 months and famous for its intense salty flavor, but the high point of Umbrian charcuterie is actually L'Antico di Norcia, a type of ham matured slowly in the brisk and dry mountain air for two whole years."
56,Jambon du Kintoa,France,Pyrénées-Atlantiques,"Jambon du Kintoa is a renowned dry-cured ham made with pork meat coming from free-range pigs, known as pie noir du Pays Basque.

58,Drniski prsut,Croatia,Drnis,"Considered to be of the best quality of all the Croatian prosciuttos, Drnis prosciutto is a cured, smoked and dried ham produced in this region since the 14th century. It is scientifically proven that the submediterranean microclimate conditions around Drnis make this type of ham different from those produced in Istria or Dalmatia. The thighs used in the production of prsut must be of premium quality, sourced locally and weigh more than 11 kilograms. The prepared meat is salted, pressed, cold-smoked and dried for a minimum of 12 months. It is dried in the wind, and the balance between the cold and dry Bora wind, and the warmer Jugo wind, is essential for it to develop all its characteristic aromas and flavors."
59,Los Pedroches,Spain,Province Of Córdoba,"Los Pedroches is a ham or shoulder from purebred Ibérico pigs made in the north of the province of Córdoba. The microclimate and other natural conditions in this region combined with green pasture and the special diet of the Iberian pigs make this ham unique.

Only the Large White, Landrance and Duroc pig breeds are used for Modena ham, and all involved production techniques are extremely detailed with precise regulations on slaughter, tracking marks, trimming, salting and greasing. The curing period lasts for a minimum of 14 months. Prosciutto di Modena is famous for its intense aroma and a delicate, less salty taste."
61,Schwarzwälder Schinken,Germany,Black Forest,"Black Forest ham is the best-selling smoked ham in Europe. It is made from the hind leg of the pig, spiced according to producers' own traditional recipes, and cold smoked using fir wood from the Black Forest. The spices used are salt, garlic, coriander, pepper, and juniper berries. As a result, the ham has a dark layer of meat on the outside but a vibrant red color on the inside with a typical smoky aroma. Black Forest ham is boneless and always contains about 20% fat, and it has a nutty and spicy flavor. This ham is easily found in many restaurants, and may be eaten raw or used as an ingredient in cooked dishes."

In the past, this cured meat product was a staple of poor farmers who did not waste any part of their precious animals. Coppiette is traditionally dried in pairs - hence its name - and it used to be prepared with the sinewy hind limb muscle tissue of sheeps, goats, donkeys, and horses."
63,Jamón de Serón,Spain,Serón,"Jamón de Serón is a ham made exclusively within the municipality of Serón from pigs of Duroc, Large White, Landrace, Blanco Belga, Pietrain or Chato Murciano breeds. This ham owes its excellence to the slow and long process of curing and drying that takes more than 16 months to complete. A good proportion of infiltrated fat between the bright pink to red muscle fibers gives this ham a shiny appearance and smooth texture."
64,File Elena,Bulgaria,Elena,"File Elena is a dried raw meat product made from chilled or frozen pork tenderloin. The name refers to the city of Elena in northern Bulgaria. When the country was a part of the Ottoman Empire, it was almost impossible to sell pork products for religious reasons. The first record of a product similar to Elena being made from pork dates back to the 1850s. The fillets, locally called ribitsa, are salted and dried in a controlled environment suitable for natural microflora to develop and provide the meat with its typical aroma."
65,Jambon Noir de Bigorre,France,Hautes-Pyrénées,"Jambon noir de Bigorre is a cured ham made with pork from purebred Gascon Noir de Bigorre pigs.

Country ham can be either baked or boiled and is very versatile. It can be served as an appetizer or as a main course, and it pairs well with other meat dishes, gravies, salads, and even seafood. No matter the method, country ham is best served thinly sliced at room temperature."
67,Peameal Bacon,Canada,Toronto,"This bacon is a classic Canadian meat product made with a boneless center-cut pork loin that is typically trimmed of fat, then cured in brine, and finally enclosed in a coating of ground cornmeal, which gives it its signature yellow-hued crust and incomparable flavor. The original coating consisted of ground yellow peas called peameal, which is how the bacon got its name. Subtly sweet, nutty, and with a hint of saltiness, peameal bacon is not smoked nor pre-cooked, so it requires some preparation prior to consumption."
68,Prosciutto Toscano,Italy,Tuscany,"Produced under the same strict laws and traditions since the 15th century, Prosciutto Toscano is made exclusively with pigs born, bred, fattened and slaughtered in Tuscany. All pig legs must be provided with the breeder certificate to prove their provenance. The Tuscan hams are then salted and air cured for about 12 to 16 months whereas other Italian hams can only be salt-cured, Prosciutto Toscano can be cured and flavored with a blend of natural spices that are common in traditional Tuscan cuisine, including pepper, garlic, rosemary, and juniper."
69,Jamón ibérico de cebo,Spain,,"This Iberian ham variety comes from black Iberian pigs of either 75% or 50% Iberian breed. The difference between this variety and the other two Iberian ham varieties, namely the bellota and the cebo de campo varieties, which are made from pigs with the same Iberian breed percentage, lies in the pigs' diet and their rearing. Pigs used in the production of jamón ibérico de cebo are typically raised on farms, in pens, and their diet consists only of natural commercial feed. Accounting for about 80% of the total Iberian ham production, ibérico de cebo is undoubtedly the most prevalent Iberian ham variety and bears a white label."
70,Culatello di Zibello,Italy,Province Of Parma,"Known as crème de la crème of Italian hams, with a tradition dating back to the 14th century, Culatello di Zibello is one of the most prized products of Parma nowadays made only with pigs raised in the regions of Emilia-Romagna and Lombardia. Culatello is tender, rich in flavor and has a refined, winey taste. It is one of the leaner forms of cured pork, cut from the best part of the whole fresh ham, and cured with a mixture of salt, pepper, garlic and dry white wine. Since it is stuffed in a natural casing, most often a pig's bladder, and tied with twine, Culatello is sometimes classified as a type of salami."
71,Istarski prsut,Croatia,Istria,"One of the staple ingredients of Croatian cuisine, Istrian prsut or prosciutto is a traditional cured and dried ham. It is usually served thinly sliced as an entree, alongside some artisanal bread and sheep or goat milk cheese. Its production is the simpler than those of other prosciuttos, as it is not smoked and is processed without its skin. After its skin and fat are removed, it is salted with coarse salt, pressed and rubbed with the mixture of black pepper, garlic, and different herbs. It is then dried for a few months in the wind before it is left to mature and ferment for the final six to eight months."
72,Jambon de Bayonne,France,Bayonne,"Jambon de Bayonne is a dried, boneless pork ham from south-eastern France that matures for at least seven months and is salted using salt from the Adour river basin. During the maturation process, the ham gets tender and develops its distinctive aroma with hazelnut notes, and delicate taste, along with its melt-in-the-mouth properties when sliced thinly. In the past, it was often served on the tables of royalty and the wealthy. It can be eaten as a starter, thinly sliced and paired with olives or cheese, in salads with spinach, asparagus, melon and cheese or as a main course with chicken, potatoes, in tarts or fricassées."
73,Guanciale,Italy,Italy,"The salt-cured pork jowl is considered to be one of the fundamental ingredients in Italian cuisine for which there are no proper substitutes. When pressed, guanciale (lit. pillow) has a deep, much richer sweet-savory pork flavor than both Italian pancetta or bacon, and due to its high fat-to-meat ratio, it has a meltingly tender texture. Guanciale is used in a number of traditional Italian recipes, particularly in classic Roman pasta dishes like bucatini alla Amatriciana and spaghetti alla carbonara."
74,Jabugo,Spain,Jabugo,"Named after a village nestled in the Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche Nature Park, in the northern part of the Andalusian province of Huelva, Jabugo is a variety of the popular Spanish Ibérico ham or shoulder ham made from the meat of the pure-bred Iberian pig or cross-breed of the local Manchado de Jabugo pig, with at least 75 % Iberian blood. The unique metabolism of these animals allows their fat to integrate into the muscles, evenly marbling the meat, which results in the distinctive flavor and juiciness of each ham. Reared in the so-called 'dehesas', agro-forested lands used primarily for grazing, sparsely wooded with holm and cork oaks, Iberian pigs gorge on acorns which give the meat a particularly sweet and nutty flavor."
75,Dalmatinski prsut,Croatia,Dalmatia,"Dalmatinski prsut is a cured, smoked, and dried ham that is usually served thinly sliced alongside bread, cheese, or fruit such as melon. Unlike its Italian (prosciutto) and Istrian counterparts, the Dalmatian version of prut is wood-smoked and dried for a minimum of twelve months. It is produced with fresh pork legs, with the bone, skin and subcutaneous fat. After preparation, which includes dry-salting, pressing, and seasoning, it is smoked and left to dry and mature in the air. The final period is strongly influenced by the cold and dry Bora wind, which creates favorable conditions for maturation."
76,Prosciutto di San Daniele,Italy,San Daniele Del Friuli,"Produced in the hilly area around the town of San Daniele in the province of Udine, Prosciutto di San Daniele is even sweeter and darker in color with a more delicate flavor than in other varieties. In the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, where the winds from the Carnic Alps meet the breezes coming in from the Adriatic, Prosciutto di San Daniele is made using only local sea salt. The curing process here differs a little from other regions since San Daniele hams are stacked on top of each other and left to mature for at least 13 months. Up until recently, only large pig breeds such as Landrace, Large White and Duroc were used for ham production, however due to an increase in demand, San Daniele hams can now be made with other local breeds."
77,Pancetta,Italy,Italy,"This traditional Italian delicacy is made from salt-cured pork belly, which is occasionally spiced with fennel, pepper, or nutmeg. Unlike other similar cured meats, pancetta is not usually smoked, but merely cured and left to dry, usually for months at a time. Smoked varieties do exist, but they are nowhere near as common as the simple, clean-tasting cured type. It comes in two forms - rolled, typical of northern Italy, and in its original flat form, which is favored in central and southern Italy."
78,Jamón Serrano,Spain,Spain,"Jamón Serrano is a cured ham produced using the traditional methods dating back to Roman times. This ham has a bright pink to purple color and shiny appearance when cut. This ham is made in four separate steps that include salting, washing, post-salting, and drying or maturation. Jamón Serrano is cured and dried without skin for more than a year and has a delicate and characteristic aroma. Not much salt is used during the production of this emblematic ham, which makes it only slightly salty and brings out sweet notes that complement the flavor beautifully."
79,Bresaola della Valtellina,Italy,Valtellina,"The origins of this air-dried, salted beef charcuterie can be traced back to the late Middle Ages, when the techniques of preserving beer, lamb and game had already spread throughout the Lombardian Valtellina valley and Alps. This lean and tender beef cut comes in five different varieties: Punta d Anca (loin), Sottofesa (top beef), Magatello (round roll), Sottosso (silverside), and Fesa (rump). The meat needs to age for about two to three months, until it completely dries out, becomes hard and turns dark red. Bresaola has a particularly sweet and musky aroma, and it is best enjoyed in traditional Lombardian starter dishes such as Bresaola della Valtellina Santa, where the meat is thinly sliced and served on rye bread with curls of juniper butter."
80,Jamón 100% ibérico de bellota,Spain,Spain,"Regarded as the most exquisite variety of Iberian ham, or jamón ibérico, this ham is made with the meat of 100% purebred black Iberian pigs that have been roaming freely across oak pastures (Dehesa) and feeding on an acorn-based (bellota) diet. Apart from these specifications, the pigs also have to be reared in one of the designated places of origin as well as fulfill the specified standards of bellota ham production to receive the most renowned black label or pata negra status - denoting the highest-quality Iberian ham."
81,Presunto,Portugal,Portugal,"This Portuguese cured ham is similar to Spanish jamón and Italian prosciutto. Presunto is a modern continuation of the ancient tradition of curing meat, a process that protects the nutritional value, flavor, and texture of the original ingredient. The first written records of the production of cured ham are from a 300BC description by Roman historian Cato the Elder. At the time, the process was somewhat different and included large amounts of salt, which affected the final flavor of the meat."
82,Prosciutto di Parma,Italy,Province Of Parma,"Carefully crafted with the same diligent care since the Roman times, Prosciutto di Parma is a true masterwork of time and tradition, and a gold standard of Italian prosciutto. The pigs of the Large White, Landrace and Duroc breed used in the production of this ham must also meet high quality standards, be bred in one of 10 northern and central Italian regions and fed a diet of grains, cereals and whey of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, which contributes to the complex taste of the meat. Apart from the characteristic microclimate of the Parma region, which is ideal for the drying of prosciutto, a vital part of the curing process is salting. The expert Maestro Salatore (salt master) measures the minimum amount of sea salt required to preserve the meat."
83,Jamón ibérico de bellota,Spain,Spain,"This variety of Iberian ham is produced with meat coming from acorn-fed Iberian pigs that are either 75% or 50% pure Iberian breed, meaning they have been crossbred with other pigs such as the Duroc breed. As in the case of jamón 100% ibérico de bellota, the pigs used in the production of this ham are allowed to roam freely across the oak pasturelands in their final rearing stage, known as the montanera, eating an acorn-based diet until they reach the desired weight for the sacrifice, or the matanza as the Spanish call it. Jamón ibérico de bellota makes for about 13% of the total Iberian ham production and is distinguished by a red label. The designated areas of Iberian bellota ham production include the Dehesa de Extremadura, Salamanca, Huelva, and Valle de Los Pedroches in Spain, along with Barrancos in Portugal."
84,Jamón Ibérico,Spain,Spain,"Jamón Ibérico is a unique ham produced both in Spain and in Portugal. It is made from black ibérico pigs who eat a diet of corn, acorns, and other feed, most of them roaming freely across the pastures. As a result, the cured ham is dark red, marbled with veins of fat. Its flavor is sweet, nutty, and just slightly salty. There are four types of jamón ibérico, depending on the diet of the pigs, namely de bellota (acorns, three years minimum), 100% de bellota, cebo de campo (cereals, free-range pigs), and de cebo (cereals, commercially reared pigs)."
85,Jerky,US,,"This delicious snack is made with lean meat that is trimmed of fat, cut into thin strips, dried, and salted to preserve it. There is evidence that jerky was consumed and prepared in ancient Egypt, and it is known to have been a popular food among Native American civilizations. It would be made when game was plentiful, and the dried, salted meat could be stored to help them survive the winter when hunting or farming was impossible. Jerky was also ideal as it was easy to transport, which perfectly suited the nomadic lifestyle of many Native American tribes."
86,Bayonne ham,France,Bayonne,"The ham is a slightly sweet, delicately flavoured meat with little salt to the taste. It is generally cut very thin and has a chewy texture in comparison to cooked hams."

"
91,Capocollo,Italy,,"In its production, capocollo is first lightly seasoned often with red and sometimes white wine, garlic, and a variety of herbs and spices that differs depending on region. The meat is then salted (and was traditionally massaged) and stuffed into a natural casing, and hung for up to six months to cure.

Next, it is washed several times to remove the salt, and is hung in a dark, well-ventilated environment. The surrounding air is important to the final quality of the ham; the best results are obtained in a cold climate."
108,Tsamarella,Greece,Cyprus,"It consists usually of goat's meat (the whole animal without its bones) that is salted and cured for preservation.
