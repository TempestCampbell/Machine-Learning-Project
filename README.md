# Wine Points and Machine Learning

Predicting wine scores using temperature (low, high, average), precipitation, humidity, and cloudiness for each of the months during the average grape growing season (March-August). Multivariate Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Neural Networks were used.






## Analysis
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Neural Networks
  - Non-Categorical:
      The data proved to be inconclusive without categories but not providing an indication of improvement when adjusting the    following factors: Epochs, Number of Neurons(units), Layers, Change out the activation, and Loss functions.
  - Categorical

## Conclusion
Next time provided more time:
- More categories of smaller sizes
- Larger dataset
- More diverse weather data (i.e. pollution)
- Include other areas (i.e. France or other countries)
- More wine to include a wider spread of points
- Look into wine varieties

Other factors to consider:
- Climate
- Technology
- Environmental factors (pollution, soil nutrients, etc.)
- Vine age
